# Blog CLI Documentation

## Introduction

This is a Blog Command Line Interface (CLI) application designed for managing blog posts.

2.	View All Blog Posts
Displays all blog posts stored in memory, showing their ID, title, author, date, and content.
3.	Edit a Blog Post
Lets the user edit an existing blog post by specifying its ID. The user can update the title, content, and author.
4.	Delete a Blog Post
Deletes a blog post by its ID, removing it permanently from the in-memory storage.
5.	Search Blog Posts
